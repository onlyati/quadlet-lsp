  - Provide static completion based on Podman Quadlet documentation
  - Query images, volumes, networks, pods, and so on, and provide completion
    based on real configuration
- Hover menu
- Implemented "go definition" and "go references" functions

## Usage with Neovim

There is a plugin made for this language server:

- [Repository](https://github.com/onlyati/quadlet-lsp.nvim)

## Usage with VS Code

There is a simple VS Code extension to use it:

- [MarketPlace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onlyati.quadlet-lsp)
- [Repository](https://github.com/onlyati/quadlet-lsp-vscode-extension)

## Usage with Zed

There is a third-party Zed extension that makes use of `quadlet-lsp`:

- [Marketplace](https://zed.dev/extensions/quadlet)
- [Repository](https://github.com/mufeedali/zed-quadlet/)

## Alternate usage

This binary can be used as a CLI syntax checker for Quadlet files. This can be
useful, for example in CI/CD pipeline to verify Quadlets before packaging and
later deploying.

Same rule applied for CLI that is also applied for editor syntax checking. The
`.quadletrc.json` file is also used on same way.

Example for usage, that monitor the current working directory:

```bash
$ quadlet-lsp check .
nc-db.container     , quadlet-lsp.qsr003, 09.000-09.010, Invalid property is found: Container.Memory
nc-app.container    , quadlet-lsp.qsr003, 08.000-08.010, Invalid property is found: Container.Memory
$ echo $?
4
```

Binary return with non-zero return code if it find any non information finding.
