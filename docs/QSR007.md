# QSR007 - Invalid format of Environment variable

## Message

> Invalid format: _%reason%_

## Explanation

Environment variables are represented as key-value pairs. If you need to assign
a value containing spaces or the equals sign to a variable, put quotes around
the whole assignment. Variable expansion is not performed inside the strings and
the "$" character has no special meaning.

This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables
will be set. If the same variable is listed twice, the later setting will
override the earlier setting. If the empty string is assigned to this option,
the list of environment variables is reset, all prior assignments have no
effect.

Correct examples:

```ini
Environment=FOO=BAR "MyVar=MyValue" 'foo=bar'
Environment=FOO=
Environment='fooVariable=barValue'
```

After `5.6.0` version, it accept environment variable without assignment. In
this case, the value is get from the host.

```ini
Environment=FOO
```
