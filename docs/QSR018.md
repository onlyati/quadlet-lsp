# QSR018 - Container cannot publish port with pod

## Message

> Container cannot have PublishPort because belongs to a pod: _%pod_file%_

## Explanation

A Pod in Podman shares a network namespace across all containers inside it. The
pod is the unit that binds to the host network (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8080), not the
individual containers.

Each container in the pod uses 127.0.0.1 to reach other containers in the same
pod.
