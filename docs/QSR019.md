# QSR019 - Container cannot have network with pod

## Message

> Container cannot have Network because belongs to a pod: _%pod_file%_

## Explanation

When you create a pod, it gets a single network namespace that all containers in
the pod share. So: Containers in the same pod communicate over localhost
(127.0.0.1). You assign the network (e.g. --network) when creating the pod, not
per container.
