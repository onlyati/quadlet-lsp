# QSR024 - Not recommended property usage in Service section

## Message

> Usage in rootless podman is not recommended: Service._%property%_

## Explanation

Note that Quadlet units do not support running as a non-root user by defining
the
[User, Group](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#User=),
or
[DynamicUser](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#DynamicUser=)
systemd options. If you want to run a rootless Quadlet, you will need to create
the user and add the unit file to one of the above rootless unit search paths.

If this is a rootful Podman, you can ignore the message.
