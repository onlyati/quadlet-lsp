# QSR008 - Invalid format of Annotation

## Message

> Invalid format: _%reason%_

## Explanation

Annotation variables are represented as key-value pairs. If you need to assign a
value containing spaces or the equals sign to a variable, put quotes around the
whole assignment. Variable expansion is not performed inside the strings and the
"$" character has no special meaning.

This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables
will be set. If the same variable is listed twice, the later setting will
override the earlier setting. If the empty string is assigned to this option,
the list of environment variables is reset, all prior assignments have no
effect.

Correct examples:

```ini
Annotation=FOO=BAR "MyVar=MyValue" 'foo=bar'
Annotation=FOO=
Annotation='fooVariable=barValue'
```
