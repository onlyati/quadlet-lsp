# QSR004 - Image name is not fully qualified

## Message

> Image name is not fully qualified

## Explanation

The specified image name is not fully qualified:

```ini
[Container]
Image=debian:bookworm-slim
```

Use fully qualified image name instead. It means that the image must begin with
`localhost` or with a valid address (e.g.: something.tld). It can also contains
port number.

Some examples:

```ini
Image=docker.io/library/debian:bookworm-slim
Image=ghcr.io/henrygd/beszel/beszel-agent
Image=localhost/test
Image=localhost:5000/test
Image=example.com:5000/test
```
